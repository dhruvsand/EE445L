// PB7 A+  PWM 100 Hz, right motor, PWM positive logic
// PB6 A-  regular GPIO, right motor, 0 means forward
// PB5 B+  PWM 100 Hz, left motor, PWM negative logic
// PB4 B-  regular GPIO, left motor, 1 means forward
// PD0 is servo A, 20ms period, pulse time 0.5 to 2.5ms
// PD1 was servo B, but no software written for PD1
